Um, I think I'm going for all. My favorite jeans are dirty, so and I wanted to be comfortable. That's something else. Last thing I want to talk about before we do. Q. And A is shopping on a budget already kind of late. Cover this or whatever, but let me tell you, you didn't I? I hate spending a lot of money on clothes. There's nothing that excites me more than like finding a cool piece In a thrift store that's all so much more rewarding and so much more unique. And I know for me I have. I don't really like wearing things that I see other people wearing, because it just I don't know if it's an ego thing or what it is, but I kind of like to be a little different, you know? I mean, I'm not saying I wear the same fucking brandy Melville grace weapons that everybody else wears. But, like sometimes it's nice to like have something that's kind of one of a kind.

Vintage pants, one of a kind no one else has for, like anywhere between 20 bucks and like no, even lower. I've gotten like a skirt off deep pop that was fully from the nineties. So dope. 10 bucks and it fits perfect. It's so fucking cool. $10 free shipping. Okay, it was amazing. Or even vintage shoes vintage. Like Doc Martens, a of into talk warns on there for cheaper vintage hoodies for like, 30 bucks, and they're in great condition. Deep Pop is an amazing, amazing tool, and also you can sell on their to. I've bought so much shit off deep pop recently, and it's nicer than going into a thrift store because you concerts thrift for store for hours and have no luck or you can, depending where you live. L. A is just not very lucky, cause every one thrift year. So it's kind of secrets up In all of the vintage stores here. Just go to the thrift stores by shit that they know that kids in L. A would want and then sell them for $100 at their store. So that's how that works. But deep pop dude buying, one of a kind things that are cheap on wherever that's the key, that is the key. It's a win win win situation. There's really not a point that you're not winning and that also, if you're using deep pop, you could be selling stuff at the same time. So you could be selling and buying. And then it's like, you know, the money's kind of at a neutral there, and it's just fucking win, bro. So check that out.</td>\n",

       "285  Like a girl in the nineties who is going Thio Home Depot early in the morning with her dad to make out, would cause they're building a tree house that survived that outfit gives me, You know what I mean? I wanna have something like that with every outfit that I wear. Although right now I'm literally wearing brown cargo shorts and a crew neck, so I don't really know what I'm going for today. Um, I think I'm going for all. My favorite jeans are dirty, so and I wanted to be comfortable. That's something else. Last thing I want to talk about before we do. Q. And A is shopping on a budget already kind of late. Cover this or whatever, but let me tell you, you didn't I? I hate spending a lot of money on clothes. There's nothing that excites me more than like finding a cool piece In a thrift store that's all so much more rewarding and so much more unique. And I know for me I have. I don't really like wearing things that I see other people wearing, because it just I don't know if it's an ego thing or what it is, but I kind of like to be a little different, you know? I mean, I'm not saying I wear the same fucking brandy Melville grace weapons that everybody else wears. But, like sometimes it's nice to like have something that's kind of one of a kind. Recently been using deep pop again? Wish this responsible. Deep up, I think we did a brand with deep Yeah, we worked a deep a before deep op hit airline again. I love you all. I've been going on deep hop so much because it's great you can search like vintage vintage pants, right? And then you can filter out just sizes that it's only your sizes that your scrolling through you confined literally dope. Vintage pants, one of a kind no one else has for, like anywhere between 20 bucks and like no, even lower. I've gotten like a skirt off deep pop that was fully from the nineties. So dope. 10 bucks and it fits perfect. It's so fucking cool. $10 free shipping. Okay, it was amazing. Or even vintage shoes vintage. Like Doc Martens, a of into talk warns on there for cheaper vintage hoodies for like, 30 bucks, and they're in great condition. Deep Pop is an amazing, amazing tool, and also you can sell on their to. I've bought so much shit off deep pop recently, and it's nicer than going into a thrift store because you concerts thrift for store for hours and have no luck or you can, depending where you live. L. A is just not very lucky, cause every one thrift year. So it's kind of secrets up In all of the vintage stores here. Just go to the thrift stores by shit that they know that kids in L. A would want and then sell them for $100 at their store. So that's how that works. But deep pop dude buying, one of a kind things that are cheap on wherever that's the key, that is the key. It's a win win win situation. There's really not a point that you're not winning and that also, if you're using deep pop, you could be selling stuff at the same time. So you could be selling and buying. And then it's like, you know, the money's kind of at a neutral there, and it's just fucking win, bro. So check that out.                                                                                                                            \n",

In this Podcast, we examine how Jeff Bezos turned a small online bookseller into one of the most powerful companies in the world.
